# LambdaLand

**LambdaLand** is a language agonostic(mostly java) functional programming sandbox designed to explore and practice core FP concepts such as **streams**, **lambdas**, **Optionals**, **pure functions**, and **immutability**. It is intended for learning, experimentation, and creating small algorithmic pipelines in a clean and maintainable style.

## Features

- **Streams & Pipelines**: Transform and process collections in a functional manner.  
- **Optionals**: Handle nullable values safely without explicit null checks.  
- **Pure Functions**: Promote predictability and testability.  
- **Immutability**: All data structures remain unmodified, following FP principles.  
- **Mini Games & Algorithms**: Demonstrates practical FP applications such as number transformations and functional pipelines
